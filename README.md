# ‚≠êÔ∏è Introduction

Introducing the **C¬∑ZAN** design system, named in honor of Paul Cezanne, a renowned painter from Aix-en-Provence, France. This framework is a wrapper of [Material 3](https://m3.material.io/), Google's
open-source design system, and is specifically adapted for apps running on [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

This system is following the [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) methodology, where atoms, molecules, organisms and templates are the different levels of design you can
use to build your app.

# üíæ Installation

We are using [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/) to publish the library.
Add the following block in your root `build.gradle.kts` at the end of repositories, (or in your `settings.gradle.kts` if you have one):

```groovy
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' } // <- This line
    }
}
```

Then add C¬∑ZAN dependency to your app `build.gradle.ktx`:

```groovy
implementation('com.github.Tweener:c-zan-android:$czan_version')
```

The latest version is: [![](https://jitpack.io/v/Tweener/c-zan-android.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#Tweener/c-zan-android)

Sync Project with Gradle files and that's it!
