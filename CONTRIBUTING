# Contribute to CÂ·ZAN
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

Proposing new features


## Create a pull request
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
3. Join any visual assets (images, videos, GIFs) to showcase your work.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
